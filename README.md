# GMOD-LIDAR
A fork of Dat√¶'s original LIDAR Gamemode for Garry's Mod with a primary focus of enabled multiplayer mode and removing the jump scare. Forked from the very popular GMOD-LIDAR mod, the experience of viewing your game through a LIDAR camera remains, but several fixes and QOL improvements have been implemented.

## Features
- Multiplayer mode has been enabled. Took steps to convert to the typical mod format.
- The spawn menu has been enabled, making it possible to use other mod assets.
- Zooming in and out is now now longer broken in multiplayer.
- Several motion mechanics have been reenabled - the ability to sprint, vault, etc

The following changes have been made:
- Enabled spawn menu.
- Enabled spawning items and entities.
- Enabled sprinting.
- Enabled zooming LIDAR gun radius in and out in multiplayer.
- Maps can now spawn their own npcs.
- The "R" key clears your screen regardless of `sv_cheats` status.
